# About Me

Hi! My name is Yuchen Tang. I am currently working in Poincare Lab, Huawei, as an Operating System engineer.

My past projects and my major research interests focuses on building next solutions for next generation Data Centers. Currently, I am deeply involved in a gigantic software-hardware co-design project, where we are using FPGA-based CXL 1.1 devices to achieve memory node expansion.

Here is my [CV](files/YuchenTang.pdf).
