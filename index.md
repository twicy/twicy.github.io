# About Me

Hi! My name is Yuchen Tang. Currently, I am about to graduate from Stony Brook University with a M.S. in Computer Engineering. Here at Stony Brook, I was lucky to work closely with [Prof. Michael Ferdman](https://compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mferdman/) and [Prof. Erez Zadok](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ezk/) on low level system research projects, such as high performance Ethernet device driver and Compute Express Link (CXL) based zero-copy VM live migration. I also did a great school project with [Prof. Mikhail Dorojevets](https://www.ece.stonybrook.edu/~midor/) on optimizing SGEMM CUDA kernel to $80\%-85\%$ of cuBLAS performance.

Prior to that, I was employed by Huawei for 2 years, as an Operating System engineer, where I researched into tiered memory systems (industry demonstrated) and HPC systems (award-winning).

Before my employment, I received a B.S. in CS from the University of Michigan, and a B.S. in ECE from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Here is my [Resume](files/Yuchen_Tang_20251202.pdf). If you are interested please kindly let me know!
