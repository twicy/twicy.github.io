# About Me

My name is Yuchen Tang. I am currently studying at Stony Brook University, pursuing a M.S. degree in Computer Engineering. I consider myself as a system guy,
being constantly curious about Operating Systems, Kernel by-passing techniques (sarcastically), and also new emerging momory tiers, such as CXL.

Prior to being a master student, I worked in Huawei for 2 years, focusing on tiered memory systems. During, I had the chance to play with FPGA-based CXL 1.1 devices, aiming to enlarge memory nodes at a lower cost. I wrote a kernel moduel to selectively carry out either access-bit-scanning or hardware-access-counter policy.

I received my B.S. degree in ECE from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a B.S. degree in CS from University of Michigan. Sadly, UM-SJTU Joint Institute has come to an end, but the hope and good will of cooperation and communication preserves.

I will be applying to 2026 Fall PhD programs, if you are interested in me, please let me know!

Here is my [Resume](files/Yuchen_Tang_Resume.pdf).
