# About Me

Hi, I am Yuchen Tang. I am currently an Operating System engineer in Poincare Lab, Huawei. My interest lies in building solutions for **next generation data centers**, from mulitple perspectives, including memory, networks and storage.

This is barely a simple website, and only tells little about myself. Feel free to reach out to me through email: <twicy@umich.edu> and <garretttang@outlook.com>

Nothing creational in terms of the construction of the website.
